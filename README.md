This repository contains:
- the two Jupyter Notebooks used for performing the 1D simulations and all the analyses ("analyses_BuoyancyDominant.ipynb" and "analyses_BuoyancyDominant.ipynb")
- the 1D model as Fortran Modules and the Fortran codes needed for generating these modules (in the folders "scm_oce_DG" = k-ɛ, "scm_oce_DGNG" = kɛt, and "scm_oce_DGNG_test" = kɛt with σvarT = 10)
- the files needed to perform the LES simulations (in the folder "LEScode")
- the LES results as netCDF files.

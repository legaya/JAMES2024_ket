# James2024-ket

This repository contains:
- the three Jupyter Notebooks used for performing the 1D simulations and all the analyses ("analyses_FC.ipynb", "analyses_W.ipynb", and "analyses_DC.ipynb")
- the 1D model as Fortran Modules and the Fortran codes needed for generating these modules (in the folders "scm_oce_DG" = k-ɛ, "scm_oce_DGNG" = kɛt)
- the version of the "oceanmixedlayers" package we used (Reichl et al., 2022; https://github.com/breichl/oceanmixedlayers)
- the files needed to perform the LES simulations (in the folder "LEScode")
- the LES results as netCDF files ("LES_FC_results.nc", "LES_W_results.nc", and "LES_DC_results.nc")
